## üîí GOOGLE ADS POLICY COMPLIANCE

### Why Third-Party Repair Ads Get Banned

Google's **"Other Restricted Businesses"** policy blocks ads for:
- Tech support services by third-party providers
- Keywords like "repair," "fix," "technician," "service center"
- Anything that could be perceived as scammy tech support

### The Workaround: Problem-Based Advertising

**‚ùå BANNED APPROACH:**
"iPhone Repair Service in Bangalore"
‚Üí Triggers: repair + service

**‚úÖ COMPLIANT APPROACH:**
"iPhone Screen Cracked? We Can Help"
‚Üí Targets: the problem, not the service

### Critical Keywords to AVOID in Ad Copy

**Never Use in Headlines:**
- repair
- fix (minimize usage)
- service center
- technician
- support
- maintenance
- shop

**Never Use in Descriptions:**
- We repair
- Repair shop
- Service center near you
- Expert technicians (use "specialists" instead)
- Apple repair (trademark issue)

### Safe Alternative Language

| ‚ùå Banned | ‚úÖ Safe Alternative |
|----------|-------------------|
| Repair | Restore / Replace / Recovery |
| Fix | Resolve / Restore / Help |
| Technician | Specialist / Expert / Engineer |
| Service Center | Service Provider / Care Center |
| Repair Shop | Service Location |
| Fix your phone | Get your phone working |

**If reason is "Misrepresentation":**
- Remove "repair" from headlines
- Change "fix" to "help" or "restore"
- Remove any guarantee claims like "100% fixed"

**Before:**
```
Headline: iPhone Repair Service Bangalore
```

**After:**
```
Headline: iPhone Screen Cracked? We Can Help
```

**Step 3: Fix Landing Page (if needed)**

**If reason is "Destination not working" or "Malicious or unwanted software":**
- Verify landing page loads properly
- Check for any popup forms (remove them)
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled
- Add Privacy Policy & Terms pages

**Step 4: Request Review**

1. Click **"Request Review"** button
2. In explanation box, write:
   ```
   "We have updated our ad copy to remove service-related terminology
   and focus on problem-solving language. Our landing page provides
   transparent information about device component replacement services
   in Bangalore. We comply with all Google Ads policies."
   ```
3. Submit
4. Usually reviewed in 1-2 business days

### If Multiple Ads Keep Getting Disapproved

**Nuclear Option: Create New Campaign**

1. Pause all disapproved campaigns
2. Create fresh campaigns with ultra-safe ad copy:
   - Headlines: Only problem + location
   - Descriptions: Only benefits, no service words
   - Example: "iPhone Screen Cracked Bangalore? Same-Day Service."

3. Use only **exact match keywords** initially:
   ```
   [iphone screen cracked bangalore]
   [iphone back glass broken bangalore]
   ```

4. Once approved and running 1 week, slowly expand

### Prevention: Pre-Approval Checklist

Before creating ANY ad, verify:
- [ ] No "repair" in headline
- [ ] No "fix" used more than once
- [ ] No "service center" anywhere
- [ ] Problem-focused (not service-focused)
- [ ] Landing page loads in <2s
- [ ] Phone number is clickable
- [ ] Privacy Policy link works

## üí° FINAL TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Top 10 Success Factors

1. **‚úÖ Be Compliant First:** No amount of optimization matters if ads get disapproved
2. **‚úÖ Focus on Quality Score:** Better score = lower costs, better position
3. **‚úÖ Mobile is King:** 80% of traffic will be mobile, optimize for it
4. **‚úÖ Test, Test, Test:** Run 3+ ad variations, let data decide winners
5. **‚úÖ Negative Keywords:** Add daily from search terms report
6. **‚úÖ Landing Page Speed:** <2 second load time is non-negotiable
7. **‚úÖ Call Tracking:** Most conversions will be phone calls
8. **‚úÖ Local Focus:** Emphasize Bangalore, neighborhoods, local trust
9. **‚úÖ Transparent Pricing:** Reduces wasted clicks, improves quality
10. **‚úÖ Monitor Daily:** First month requires daily attention

### What Makes Customers Choose You

Based on iFix's success and customer psychology:

**Customers want:**
1. ‚úÖ **Trust:** "1,000+ devices fixed", reviews, warranty
2. ‚úÖ **Convenience:** "Doorstep service in 60 minutes"
3. ‚úÖ **Transparency:** "See pricing online", "Watch us work"
4. ‚úÖ **Speed:** "Same-day", "60-minute response"
5. ‚úÖ **Quality:** "Premium parts", "12-month warranty"
6. ‚úÖ **Local:** "Serving Koramangala" - speaks their neighborhood

### Red Flags to Avoid

**‚ùå Never do this:**
- Use "cheapest" or "lowest price" (attracts wrong customers)
- Promise "100% fixed" (misleading)
- Use Apple logo or "Authorized" (trademark violation)
- Copy competitor ads exactly (low quality score)
- Ignore negative keywords (waste money)
- Set and forget campaigns (must optimize)
